  - Regional-based (geographic territories)
  - Order-based (specific customer/order assignments)
  - Hybrid approach for maximum flexibility

## 🔐 Authentication System

### Default Admin Account

```bash
# Create Super Admin (development)
yarn admin:seed

# Default credentials (change immediately)
Email: superadmin@jooav.com
Password: password123
Role: SUPER_ADMIN
```

### JWT Token Structure

```typescript
{
  sub: string,        // User ID
  email: string,      // User email
  role: UserRole,     // User role enum
  type: 'admin' | 'user',
  regions?: string[]  // Optional assigned regions
}
```
